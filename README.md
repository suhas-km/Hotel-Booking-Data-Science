# Hotel Booking ADR Prediction üè®üí∞

Project Overview üìà
This project aims to predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for hotel bookings using machine learning. We leverage historical booking data from a [2019 paper](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/311593/1-s2.0-S2352340918X00079/1-s2.0-S2352340918315191/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEPX%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIAy6RTtnqnIriNQ8Kp3%2FgHk7snFUG00VPOJew3AE8VMWAiEAqGpMe6TgMri2G9Qc%2B2hCxH6bR4i1qcmebYGmn4XYo6AqswUIbRAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDE8BoiJvSSUDmjgonyqQBfgTfZ5vL%2F8ZawXqJHtUi604ARM9D0Oxj0AMVGN0NIigTQXJLvIOdpXSn1TC7Jwba5s4dQvGxXp8inZuvdGw6kRjFjk6Tkk8i4TvG04hkXayLMf6dobj59J9JOgAQcdbyPcQy%2Bf7xPcS4SZIINGYuUsgPGH95i1tgaOKciZUMb7yayucrsLwjRCQCqDlC7ji78UCwxu%2FdrJCOWGgzoY1tevwhMJ1rmqOH6FTp%2BQolKmvgpsGRZl2wOeokDINURohyWIbW%2Fc4GN3CckEK4LhvHYdgmEgdh%2F3XiNZjGnTLOMKw3u1IQ48BMZI4F0fV6DQ39OiQkC5iAWc30LuSOgfo0J0TpZmm8ffvRGR5%2B5SPoLjzRf1ZWivQIIUCI9gzzbSiRjYe7fPvEmzdiFzEy5dCIgrMIxJ0ktAXqFLlvwkvnSyOoIq0hjsWFknaq5UK0VfrRV2LKqcG9U3eyKtAkCTXl5qGNLEqyccoUmF3O2rIKLeKKjXbg0QYIcdDzez%2FbbUJ%2FXri2Fp4JBjr%2B5JFv5arttaS%2Bvbmh2oNdTB2E5Qzge%2FG9OhUxaLXWIaNGXby1EH3CRSO12zQcmRvdhSzqW%2FQ5o6wHp7oD%2F4ll3GoUvDRwuWE%2FhK2cTwcIJChfXNmibfowVM4XIBAnuTzXbodALsEzcUTxAGbpSkCKF0iKqBp%2BR7nVbQO6NzNZunDiqdW8gHk4MqVB1nc1ZfOP7sLBhhP5iF6AT2%2BielbAm4nr%2F7mPVGFXcoDOeSqDAr1%2BObFF2v%2BAf0NYvb9N5TXpXAue%2BpewyrM7L2Sl0hXbdUxtzJGzCC1zN1Fp%2BlAZzudOuXvLc%2BxInxF%2BSFfasGU3wzPkNFoKtAGV7QaEkrkG13mqdwyWotoMOmi76sGOrEB8Kl%2BBdp2xcIxeuVMW0

## Features and Models üõ†Ô∏è
We've developed models based on features like room type, customer demographics, and booking details. Our models include:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**

The models are evaluated based on **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared** metrics.

### Model Comparisons üìä
*Performance comparison of various models.*

## Hyperparameter Tuning üîß
Extensive grid search and cross-validation techniques were employed to fine-tune the models, particularly **XGBoost**, which demonstrated superior performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning üìà
*Hyperparameter tuning results.*

## Correlation Analysis üîç
A correlation matrix was constructed to discern the relationships between different features and ADR, guiding the feature selection process.

### Correlation Matrix üìâ
*Heatmap showing feature correlations with ADR.*

## Seasonal Trends üìÖ
Seasonal trends in ADR were analyzed to understand the impact of time-related factors on hotel pricing.

### Seasonal Trends üåû‚ùÑÔ∏è
*Seasonal ADR trends by month and year.*
